I can confidently say that Suzume is an absolute masterpiece. It\\'s the best Shinkai movie so far!Suzume is a film about a protagonist who goes on a journey to \\\\\"close the doors\\\\\" on disasters. It should be noted that this is not a romance movie. While I won\\'t spoil whether any romantic elements come into play, this is primarily a story about Suzume\\'s adventure and finding closure/moving on in life.This is also very different from Your Name and Weathering With You. Gone are the RADWIMPS insert songs; in their place is a phenomenal orchestral score (my personal favorite soundtrack in a Shinkai film). While Your Name was a masterpiece in its own right, this one is on a whole new level.While there are some structural similarities, I would caution everyone not to expect Your Name 2.0 as that is not the kind of movie Suzume is trying to be. I will also say that a certain traumatic event in recent Japanese history has a role in this one, so some Japanese audience members might have a hard time with parts of the story. Finally, I didn\\'t catch any cameos from his previous entries (unless they were hidden in the background somewhere?). If these three points do not deter you, I would highly recommend watching it in theaters (whenever it is available in your location).Suzume is the most visually stunning anime film I have ever seen: I can\\'t overstate just how incredible it looks! And Suzume and Sota are my favorite leads in a Shinkai work as well. If you have already watched this masterpiece, I implore you to sign on here and rate it a 10/10 -- it deserves a score much, much higher that the 8.0/10 it currently has on IMDb. Not only is this my new favorite anime film, it\\'s one of my favorite films of all time, period.\"},{\"username\":\"rubbersoul-26239\",\"userUrl\":\"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur152371020\",\"reviewLink\":\"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8696062\",\"warningSpoilers\":false,\"date\":\"26 November 2022\",\"rate\":\"\",\"helpful\":\"6 out of 33 found this helpful.\",\"title\":\"This works because of THE director\",\"content\":\"The timing of the title was completely perfect.This film is about the earthquake but the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11th March 2011 is not mentioned even in its trailer. However it is helpful to know it to watch this film. Even though I had known it before I watched, fantasy and intense reality didn\\'t match well. This film could be generalised as a fantasy. I didn\\'t feel necessity of mentioning 3.11. Makoto Shinkai the director had created films about disasters with fantasy since \\'Your Name.\\' which made him one of great anime directors. I think it was fine with fantasy.There were some rough points such as Suzume the main character\\'s stamina, East and West at the climax and not just Japan having earthquakes. However the pictures didn\\'t let me think of it.I recognized how great Shinkai\\'s pictures were again at the first cut even animes with good backgrounds had been generous. I was surprised at the meadow and the heavenly body. The actions of the chair were cool. I liked the closeup of the key.There were so many Ghibli homages. Some were connected to the main stream of the plot and was fine to me but the other parts seemed not cool. Hayao Miyazaki\\'s earthquake in \\'Wind Rises\\' was absolutely better than this film. The last two films \\'Your Name.\\' and \\'Weathering with You\\' were smarter at the way of mentioning 3.11 than this film. I think \\'Shin Godzilla\\' was the best.It was quite easier to watch his film without line sounded like inspiration porn than within weird monologues.Only Makoto Shinkai could make this anime with his skills and all.\"},{\"username\":\"Aoi_kdr\",\"userUrl\":\"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur89944726\",\"reviewLink\":\"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8764676\",\"warningSpoilers\":false,\"date\":\"29 December 2022\",\"rate\":\"8\",\"helpful\":\"0 out of 14 found this helpful.\",\"title\":\"Nobody\\'s bad, but just there\\'s still a lot of scars.\",\"content\":\"When the movie finished, I was speechless and left the theater.

As in Shinkai\\'s previous works, the visuals are also stunning, but this time you also get a lot of nods to Ghibli movies throughout the film, through visual storytelling, which I thought was well done. There are also many returning storytelling elements from his previous films which you will immediately notice.On the surface and without getting into too many details, this is an action-oriented story that follows Suzume and Sota in their efforts to close dangerous doors that cause havoc in different places across Japan. But as I wrote in the title, there are several themes the movie explores - some of them require some afterthought or a second viewing to fully realize, in my opinion. The first one is the importance of responsibility: when you take it upon yourself to do something or take care of someone, you cannot just throw empty words and take them back later. You must own up to your decision even if it means sacrificing things that are very important to you. This is masterfully presented through the actions and interactions of several characters in this film - and helps them understand each other. The second theme is that of loss and its acceptance - the film tries to tell us that even when horrible things happen, we cannot give up since things will get better in the future. I should note here that the film uses real tragic events from Japan\\'s history to resonate this, so it may cause a more profound emotional response in Japanese people who have gone through similar events, or at least in people who are aware of the scale of the events that took place. There is also a surprising theme about God(s) here - the movie presents them as childlike fickle beings that can sometimes cause natural disasters that cause the deaths of many people, but sometimes can use their power to protect people. Finally, there is a love-story aspect here from which I was moved the least - but I guess that\\'s ok since this is not the main theme of the movie.In my personal ranking, I would put suzume no tojimari above tenki no ko but below kimi no nawa, as the emotional impact was greater for me in the latter.Definitely watch!\"},{\"username\":\"rfmrdst\",\"userUrl\":\"https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158829031\",\"reviewLink\":\"https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8675069\",\"warningSpoilers\":true,\"date\":\"14 November 2022\",\"rate\":\"5\",\"helpful\":\"4 out of 55 found this helpful.\",\"title\":\"Don\\'t watch if you\\'re unhealthy / experienced traumatic disasters...\",\"content\":\"Spoiler\\'s review since, expanded review of personal thoughts drawn out of film & Novel... who never stuck in environments drawn out in vision.As Director mentioned at Interview to one of media, he hopes we are able to find out by looking into growth of Suzume\\'s developments. He\\'s going to comes up on another interview today at 18/Nov for updates.....Since than try to focus on each Characters, to see how they relates to her.Honestly speaking from the novel, it\\'s straight forward fantasy and enjoyable... 80% of film is straight out of novel in same order.But in a viewer\\'s sense, I believe it has opportunities to expand its vision, but many of audiences are easily stuck into traumatic causes of what natural disasters may bring.From the Novel, my personal view draw out a character as one of audience, the 17yr old girl is just like \\\\\"Jack Sparrow\\\\\" to make decision which line to go across. Just like that Japan in some believe there\\'s always a door / line should not be Opened / go across. Always has consequences with it.Instead of looking at disaster as it is but anyone has such traumatic / disastrous memories want to fix, that memory is like beyond the door,... The Door than becomes like a key / change to your lifestyle, how you change is up to people.But there\\'s also a way not to touch,...But if you touched the door / matter / issues in the past, it is always good to fix. Wether relations / situations / actual objects or things that making environments worse...In Chinese old saying when Sparrow went to great sea, it became Clam, in that sense, I saw girl need to change and to grow, like Jack Sparrow.If you\\'re ever experienced Disasters, you may not be comfortable to watch Movie... I hope there\\'s unique inventions for IMAX, you could create better by linking it\\'s film with mobile apps to cut off the sirens by pressing Stop / something....For the sake of experiencing or getting reminders of it,.. maybe Could be a worthwhile experience? That traumatic sound made viewers to split their reviews...I also didn\\'t enjoy the sirens,... but if able to cut that noise by the audience\\'s options... able to enjoy it at same times draw out different stories from different viewers.I saw a sign, the door / your cause, will change, way you develop your life. So what would you say,.. I would say unlike Your Name \\\\\"with a mission\\\\\", Weathering with you \\\\\"the love letter\\\\\", Closing Doors \\\\\"to complete\\\\\".... All three as one set.It may be different views but even still director said it\\'s a relationship of 3 films only wrote novel to expand his vision. Why? I imagine he wanted see viewers vision, power of words & visions.So I love the ideas of film / Novel / theater acts are different and felt that so as I respect Shinkai, really get on board to new sea from the deep sea.I got to thank Shinkai for drawing out film that relates to the myth & truth laid in the past, May be different story but definitely had modern vision of Closed Doors. Out of 3 film, I like this one was original!!Just like when worm gone back in to the door it rains, as Weathering child prayed and rain in another\\'s intact it was, it could be harvesting rain, ... in any ways it could be related / unrelated,... Issues of environments / culture / myth / reality / emotional / self-recognition film to fix to adjust ourselves to live better!!Educational in someway, in that sense I give 5 star out of 5,... but for enjoyable? In total length speed and all that motions, 5 star out of 10, it was too slow for me. No offense...May not be worth while watching if you\\'re not fan of Shinkai /Radwimp / Novels / Anime Books ... Japanese Culture & myths.To know Shinkai better read article onbunshun-jp.translate.goog/articles/-/36462?page=5&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp.\"}],\"errorMessage\":\"\"}'\n"
